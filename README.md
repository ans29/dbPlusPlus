# CPP based database<br>
DATABASE BASICS :  <br>
	records of same types, are saved in a single table.<br>
	there can be multiple different tables in a single database.<br>
	Information about each of these tables are stored in another table of the database, called metadata table.<br>


This project simulates the database by saving the information by creating the following analogy :<br>
	objects	= single record<br>
	class	= metadata record<br>
	database= folder<br>
	table	= file<br>
