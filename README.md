# CPP based database


DATABASE BASICS : 
	records of same types, are saved in a single table.
	there can be multiple different tables in a single database.
	Information about each of these tables are stored in another table of the database, called metadata table.


This project simulates the database by saving the information by creating the following analogy :
	objects	= single record
	class	= metadata record
	database= folder
	table	= file
